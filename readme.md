$config['limitLoadData'] = 1000;
$config['enableApiKeys'] = true;

/**

Working with default example for testing
-----------------
I recommend you to use PostMan an add ons in Google Chrome to get Started with test.

1. Import reSlim-tuber.sql in your database then config your database connection in config.php inside folder "reSlim-tuber/src/"
2. Import file reSlim-tuber User.postman_collection.json in your PostMan.
3. Edit the path in PostMan. Because the example test is using my path server which is my server is run in http://localhost:1337 
    The path to run reSlim-tuber is inside folder api.<br> 
    Example for my case is: http://localhost:1337/reSlim-tuber/src/api/<br><br>
    In short, It's depend on your server configuration.
4. Then you can do the test by yourself
